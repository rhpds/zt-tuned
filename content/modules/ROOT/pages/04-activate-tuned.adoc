# Activate TuneD

Run `+tuned-adm list+` to confirm our new `+mssql-multi+` profile shows
up

[source,bash]
----
tuned-adm list
----

We can see our new mssql-multi profile is Available, so letâ€™s go ahead
and activate it

[source,bash]
----
tuned-adm profile mssql-multi
----

If we run `+tuned-adm active+` we should see that our active profile is
mssql-multi now.

[source,bash]
----
tuned-adm active
----

In order to validate that our custom override is working we can check
the value of transparent_hugepages

[source,bash]
----
cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
----

In the output, it should show the bracket around madvise

And that is it! You now have a good understanding of the benefits of
TuneD and the knowledge to create and use custom and static TuneD
profiles!
