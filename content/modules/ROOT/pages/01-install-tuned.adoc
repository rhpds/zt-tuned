# Install TuneD

TuneD is a service that monitors your system and optimizes the
performance under certain workloads

TuneD is distributed with a number of predefined profiles, which we will
review a little later in this exercise

Let’s make sure we have the `+tuned+` package installed.

Copy and paste the command below into *>_ terminal*.

For ease of use with this lab, we will elevate your user privileges.

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo su
----

[source,bash]
----
dnf list tuned
----

The output should look similar to this:

We can see `+tuned+` is listed under Installed Packages. We should also
make sure it is running and enabled:

Copy and paste the command below into *>_ terminal*.

[source,bash]
----
systemctl status tuned
----

Your output should look similiar to:

From the output above we can determine that it is active (running) and
that it is enabled so it will start at boot-up time

Let’s move on to the next step
